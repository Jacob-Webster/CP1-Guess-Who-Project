
Determine youngest player they will always go first

Step 1 > Players randomly pick a mystery character

Loop:

1. Player_Up chooses between: Guess Mystery Character, Ask Question
2. Player_Up asks question based on character looks
3. Player_Down answers yes or no
4. Player_Up eliminates characters on their board depending on response
5. switch roles

exception:

mystery player guessed right? -> Player_Up wins

mystery player guessed wrong? -> Player_Down wins

Game Loop
while wins < 5 play Game

send back to mystery character selection


Ideas:

Idea 1:

list of characters that contain booleans of whether they have certain features
2d list with 0's representing eliminated characters and ? representing people
users could select row/column to see characters details

problems: takes a long time to look at all characters, guesses that dont contain one of characters boolean values wont elimate them


Idea 2:

tkinter GUI with buttons(buttons have characters name) that make a graph(board)
players can click button and pull up a image of the character allowing them to make more precise guesses

problems: harder to eliminate characters and guesses are more subjective

Questions?

Combination of both?
along with image list a few attributes that character has to make ruling them out less subjective?
Way to view all characters at one time?
